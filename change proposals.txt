List of proposed changes by person:

Austin
1. Move shared variables and methods up to superclass to avoid repitition
2. SavingsAccount should become a subclass of TaxFreeSavingsAccount (By Liskov Substitution principle, SavingsAccount has more things than TFSA - a tax rate)
3. Seperate related tasks in ATM, TellerTerminal, and Bank classes into categories such as getters and setter
